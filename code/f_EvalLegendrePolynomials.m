% function [Pn,dPndx,d2Pndx2]=f_EvalLegendrePolynomials(n,x)
% Version 1.0
%
% This function generates the Legendre polynomials of degree n in points x.
% Both n and x are intended to be row vectors, with different dimensions,
% where the "usual" normalization is adopted.
%
% The function is based on recurrence relations for the calculation of both
% functions and first, second derivatives. The values of the function and
% of the derivatives at the [-1,1] interval endpoints are computed
% analytically.
